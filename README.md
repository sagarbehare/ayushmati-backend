## Getting Started with AYUSHMATI
The project aims to create a monitoring system for Nurses/Doctors about the
patient’s timely intake of medicines and routine updates of patients’ health data. This
system will help nurses to provide medicines and make routine check-ups on time
compared to the traditional pen-and-paper method. The prescription is to be
provided by a doctor based on the patient and illness which will be followed by
nurses. The application is to provide timely reminders to nurses about the patients
and medicine details, also in case of slippage of schedule, alerts are to be provided
to take appropriate actions without further delay. One thing to note, A patient is
onboarded into our application only after primary consultation is completed and
agreed to for admission.
